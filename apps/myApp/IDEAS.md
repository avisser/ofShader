Vision (built‑in models + detectors)

  - Face detection (rectangles, landmarks)
  - Face landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth, contours)
  - Human body pose (full body or upper body)
  - Hand pose (21 keypoints)
  - Text detection / recognition (OCR)
  - Barcode / QR detection
  - Saliency / attention (what pops out in the frame)
  - Object tracking (track a region over time)
  - Image classification & custom Core ML models

  Core ML (custom models)

  - Custom image classifiers (your own labels)
  - Object detection (bounding boxes for anything)
  - Segmentation (mask of a person, pet, etc.)
  - Style transfer / filters
  - Depth/monocular estimation
  - Gesture recognition (via pose/keypoints)

  If you want the most kid‑friendly next step, I’d suggest hand pose (turn hands into sparkles / paint emitters) or body pose (drive
  kaleidoscope center or colors from movement).
